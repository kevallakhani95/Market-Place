# Market-Place
A web application that allows users to buy different products and view the products they have bought already. 
Integrated a products feed that removes redundancy of the products bought and clumps similar products together. 
Also, added a little feature of event-based display text based on search results.

To run the application:
1. Download and set up XAMPP and MySQL
2. Import pictures.sql file at localhost/phpmyadmin
3. Login using the credentials -
    
    Username: Tom White
    Search: Search for a product using word
    
4. Enjoy the application :)
